Welcome to AgroNest! , Our comprehensive solution for fertilizer management. This project aims to streamline various aspects of farming, including Fertilizer Buying & Selling, Laboratory Management, Soil Quality Guidance, Promotions Handling, Fertilizer Data Analysis, Feedback Collection, and more.
## About Our Web Application:-
Our web application stands at the forefront of agricultural innovation, offering a holistic solution 
to streamline fertilizer management practices and empower stakeholders across the agricultural 
value chain. Utilizing state-of-the-art technologies and integrating sophisticated features, our 
platform transforms the way farmers, dealers, laboratories, and administrators engage with 
operations related to fertilizer. Fundamentally, our software makes it easier for farmers to 
collaborate and communicate, enabling them to easily search for local dealers, place orders, and 
monitor deliveries. Farmers can offer insightful input on dealer performance and soil testing 
services through integrated feedback and rating systems, promoting accountability and 
transparency in the agricultural ecosystem. Furthermore, by providing customized suggestions 
based on soil analysis, the addition of soil testing services enables farmers to make knowledgeable 
judgments about the use of fertilizer.
Administrators utilize all-inclusive dashboards and analytical instruments to track performance 
indicators, anticipate problems before they arise, and maximize the effectiveness and impact of 
fertilizer management tactics. Our application functions as a central location for the exchange of 
agricultural information and product promotion, attracting users and increasing sales through 
features like targeted distribution and promotional content management. Every facet of our 
application, from dealer profile management to fertilizer analysis reports, is painstakingly crafted 
to improve farming practices, boost production, and promote long-term farming community growth


## Libraries and Frameworks:–
##### • **React** :- A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, React can be used for developing the front-end components of our web application. Its component-based architecture and virtual DOM makes it well-suited for creating interactive and responsive UIs. 
##### • **Node.js** :- As a server-side runtime environment, Node.js allows us to run JavaScript code on the server, enabling the development of scalable and efficient backend services. It provides a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it suitable for handling asynchronous operations. 
##### • **Express.js** :- A minimalist web framework for Node.js, Express.js simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs by providing a robust set of features for routing, middleware, and HTTP utilities. It's lightweight and highly extensible, making it ideal for building RESTful APIs. 
##### • **MongoDB** :- A popular NoSQL database, MongoDB is known for its flexibility, scalability, and performance. It stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON and supports features like sharding and replication, making it suitable for handling large volumes of data. 
 ##### • **Mongoose** :- A MongoDB object modeling tool designed for Node.js, Mongoose provides a straightforward way to work with MongoDB databases by providing a schema-based solution for modeling application data. It simplifies tasks such as validation, querying, and data manipulation.

## Installation and Setup

Before proceeding, make sure your device has Node.js installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
2. Run the following command to start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory.
2. Since we ignore the node_modules in the repository, you need to install the necessary dependencies. Run the following command:
```bash
 npm i --force
```
3. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the frontend by running:
```bash
npm start
```
Now, you should be able to access the Fertilizer Management System through your web browser.
